# HTML-Projects
All HTML Projects made by Joey Yannuzzi

Unzip all the files (they do not all need to be in the same folder because they are all from different sites)

 links that link HTML websites to other pages in that website (or to another website I have created) will be broken because the file paths change when the computer it is running on changes.
 Sometimes this issue also happens with pictures (or any file that requires a local file path).
 You will need to change the file path to the correct file path in order to fix the issue.  
 The websites work as intended if this issue is fixed.
